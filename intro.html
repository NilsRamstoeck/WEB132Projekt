            For those who don't know me, please let me introduce
            myself.
        </p>
        <p>My name is Grogu, also known as Baby Yoda from Star Wars and for those who watched "the Mandalorian" known as
            "The
            Child".
        </p>
        <p>
            I was born 41 years BC on Planet Dagobah and identify as Yoda Species. My favorite food are frogs and fav
            color
            green.
            I stand at only 1.1ft (0.42m).. But don't underestimate me,
            don't let my cute and innocent face with tiny body fool you, because I could take you down in blink of an
            eye.
        </p>
